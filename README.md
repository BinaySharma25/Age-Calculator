# Age-Calculator
Built an Age Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This project includes:
Dark Mode Toggle – Easily switch between light and dark themes with a smooth toggle button.
Fully Responsive Design – Optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
Accurate Age Calculation – Users can input their birth date, and the app instantly calculates the exact age in years, months, and days.
Clean UI/UX – Built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and visual appeal.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in:
✔️ DOM manipulation.
✔️ Event handling in JavaScript.
✔️ CSS media queries and responsive layout design.
✔️ Theme toggling with CSS variables and JavaScript logic.
